                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>

                <p>
                    The gemsbok (<em>Oryx gazella</em>) is a large antelope species native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. Known for their striking appearance, gemsboks have long, straight horns and distinctive black and white facial markings. They are highly adapted to desert and semi-desert environments, capable of surviving long periods without water by obtaining moisture from the plants they eat.

                <p>
                    Gemsboks live in herds and are known for their agility and speed, which help them evade predators such as lions and hyenas. Their diet mainly consists of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. During droughts, they can survive on tough desert plants and roots.

                <p>
                    Gemsboks play an important role in their ecosystem by grazing and dispersing seeds, helping maintain the balance of their habitats.
