                <p>
                    Monkeys are highly intelligent primates found throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. There are two main types: Old World monkeys, found in Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys, found in Central and South America.

                    Known for their agility, curiosity, and playful behavior, monkeys live in trees and on the ground depending on the species. They eat a varied diet including fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and small animals.

                    Many monkeys live in social groups and communicate through facial expressions, vocalizations, and body language. Their complex social behavior makes them fascinating to observe and study.
