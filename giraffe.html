                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>

                <p>
                    The giraffe (<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>) is the tallest terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Native to African savannahs and open woodlands, giraffes are famous for their exceptionally long necks and legs, and distinctive spotted coats.

                <p>
                    Giraffes use their long necks to reach leaves and buds in tall trees, mainly feeding on acacias. Their unique cardiovascular system allows them to pump blood efficiently up their long necks. They live in loose herds and communicate with each other using infrasonic sounds that are below human hearing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite their height, giraffes can run up to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h) in short bursts to escape predators. They play a vital role in their ecosystems by browsing trees and facilitating seed dispersal.
