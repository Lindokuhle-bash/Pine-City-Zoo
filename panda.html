                <h3>PANDA</h3>

                <p>
                    The giant panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>) is one of the most beloved and recognizable animals in the world. Native to the mountain forests of central China, pandas are known for their distinctive black-and-white coloring and gentle nature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite being classified as carnivores, giant pandas have a diet that is over 99% bamboo. They spend up to 14 hours a day eating and require a large amount of bamboo to stay nourished.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pandas are solitary animals that are mostly active at dawn and dusk. They are excellent climbers and swimmers and communicate through vocalizations and scent markings. Thanks to ongoing conservation efforts, their population in the wild is slowly increasing.
