                <h3>TIGER</h3>

                <p>
                    The tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) is the largest member of the cat family and one of the most iconic and powerful predators in the world. Tigers are known for their striking orange coat with black stripes, which provides excellent camouflage in their natural habitat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tigers are solitary hunters, relying on stealth and strength to catch prey such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. They are strong swimmers and often cool off in water, unlike many other cats.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tigers are currently endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this majestic species and its shrinking wild habitats.
                </p>

                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

                <p>The tigers are housed in pen T06, located in the big cat zone near the water viewing deck.</p>
