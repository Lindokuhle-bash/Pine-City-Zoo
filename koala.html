                <h3>KOALA</h3>

                <p>
                    The koala (<em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em>) is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to Australia. Known for their fluffy ears, spoon-shaped nose, and relaxed nature, koalas are one of Australia's most iconic animals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Koalas live in eucalyptus forests and spend most of their time sleeping in the treetops. They feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients, causing them to sleep up to 20 hours a day to conserve energy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although commonly called a "koala bear," they are not bears at all, but marsupialsâ€”meaning they carry their young in a pouch. Koalas are currently threatened by habitat destruction, disease, and climate change.

                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

                <p>Koalas are located in pen K07, near the eucalyptus grove in the eastern section of the park.</p>
