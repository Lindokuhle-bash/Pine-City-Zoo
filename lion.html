                <h3>LION</h3>

                <p>
                    The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is one of the most recognizable big cats and is often referred to as the "king of the jungle." Lions are native to parts of Africa and a small population exists in Indiaâ€™s Gir Forest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lions are unique among big cats because they live in social groups called prides, which consist of related females, their cubs, and a few males. Male lions are known for their majestic manes, which make them stand out in the animal kingdom.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They are powerful predators that hunt large prey such as zebras, wildebeest, and buffalo. Lions are apex predators, playing a key role in maintaining the health and balance of their ecosystems.
