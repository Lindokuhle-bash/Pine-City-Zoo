                <h3>RHINO BEETLE</h3>

                <p>
                    Rhino beetles are a fascinating group of insects belonging to the family Scarabaeidae. Known for the horn-like structure on their heads, which resembles a rhinoceros horn, these beetles are some of the strongest animals in the world relative to their size.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rhino beetles are herbivorous and primarily feed on fruit, nectar, and sap. Males use their horns to fight rivals for mates, though the horns are not used for defense against predators.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They play an important role in their ecosystem by breaking down decaying plant material, enriching the soil, and serving as a food source for other animals.

                <p>Rhino beetles are located in the Insectarium at pen B09, near the Butterfly Garden.</p>
