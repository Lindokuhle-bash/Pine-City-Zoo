                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>

                <p>
                    The warthog (<em>Phacochoerus africanus</em>) is a wild member of the pig family native to the grasslands, savannas, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. Recognizable by their large, curved tusks and wart-like facial protrusions, warthogs are sturdy, resilient animals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite their rugged appearance, warthogs are generally peaceful and spend most of their time grazing on grasses and digging for roots. They often kneel on their front legs while feeding and will use abandoned burrows for shelter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Warthogs can run at high speeds when threatened and have been known to defend themselves fiercely using their tusks. They play a vital role in the ecosystem by turning over soil and dispersing seeds.

                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>

                <p>Youâ€™ll find the warthogs in pen W04, near the savanna loop trail.</p>
