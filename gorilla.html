                <h3>GORILLA</h3>

                <p>
                    Gorillas are the largest living primates, belonging to the genus <em>Gorilla</em>. They inhabit the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. Gorillas live in family groups called troops, led by a dominant silverback male.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Known for their intelligence and gentle behavior, gorillas primarily feed on leaves, stems, fruit, and occasionally insects. Despite their massive size and strength, they are mostly peaceful animals that communicate through vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, gorillas are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and diseases. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these magnificent animals and their natural habitats.
